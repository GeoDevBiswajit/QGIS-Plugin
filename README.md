# QGIS-Plugin
AutoFieldUpdater / TrimMaster / DupFinder / SmartCase
1) **AutoFieldUpdater**
   This custom plugin is designed to perform specific tasks tailored to the needs of the production team. It automatically updates multiple mandatory fields simultaneously, significantly       reducing the time required for each employee to complete their tasks.

2) **TrimMaster**
   It will remove all unnecessery space from each and every attribute fields at once.

3) **DupFinder**
   The DupFinder plugin is designed to identify duplicate POIs between two layers based on the `POI_NAME` attribute. It uses the FuzzyWuzzy algorithm to detect matches, even with minor     
   spelling differences, and calculates the spatial distance between duplicate POIs. The results are stored in four new fields for easy analysis and verification.

4) **SmartCase**
   SmartCase is a lightweight QGIS plugin designed to streamline attribute formatting in geospatial datasets. With a single click, SmartCase converts all attributes to uppercase while 
   intelligently handling email and website fields, which are converted to lowercase. This ensures consistent formatting, minimizes errors, and saves valuable time for GIS professionals.
